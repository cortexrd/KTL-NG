# KTL-NG (KTL Next-Gen)

## Welcome to the Future of Knack Toolkit Library

KTL-NG is the next generation of the Knack Toolkit Library, rebuilt from the ground up for Knack's new platform. This repository serves as our collaborative workspace for reimagining and reconstructing 20,000+ lines of battle-tested functionality for the modern Knack environment.

## What's Happening Here

The classic Knack platform is evolving, and KTL is evolving with it. Everything is different in the new platform - the API structure, view rendering, data models, event handling - which means we're not just porting code, we're rethinking how KTL serves developers.

This is where we:
- **Brainstorm** new approaches to familiar problems
- **Collaborate** on architecture decisions
- **Build** the next generation of KTL functionality
- **Test** in real-world scenarios
- **Share** knowledge and discoveries

## Current Status

🚧 **Active Development** - We're in the early stages of conversion and exploration. The new platform presents unique challenges and opportunities, and we're figuring them out together.

## Contributing

Whether you're a longtime KTL user or new to the framework, your input matters. The new platform affects us all, and diverse perspectives make for better solutions.

- Share your findings about the new platform
- Suggest approaches for common use cases
- Report issues you encounter
- Contribute code and documentation

## Key Differences to Explore

As we migrate, we're mapping out:
- New object model structures
- Updated event systems
- Changed field type behaviors
- Modern authentication patterns
- Enhanced API capabilities

## Stay Connected

This is a community effort. Star the repo, watch for updates, and jump into discussions. Together, we'll build KTL-NG into something even better than its predecessor.
